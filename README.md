# Yr Improvement Proposals (YIPs)

The **Yr Improvement Proposal (YIP)** repository is the central place where all
major changes, language features, tools, or governance rules for the **Yr
ecosystem** are proposed, discussed, and tracked.

YIPs allow the community to understand the direction of the language and its
official tools, while keeping the core development transparent and structured.

---

## YIP Status Workflow

Each proposal moves through clear, simple states:

- **Draft** — The YIP is being written or refined.
- **Accepted** — The YIP is approved and scheduled for implementation.
- **Rejected** — The YIP will not be implemented.
- **Superseded** — This YIP has been replaced by another YIP.
- **Completed** — The feature or change is fully implemented and released.

---

## YIP Types

Every proposal must specify a `Type:` at the top, one of:

- **language** — Changes to the Yr language itself (syntax, semantics, features).
- **process** — Changes to how Yr is developed, governed, or released.
- **informational** — Non-binding guidelines, design notes, or ideas.
- **stdlib** — Additions or changes to standard Yr libraries (future).
